<h4>Project to create an automatic keepass database to import and automate the checking of many entries.</h4>


-------
- import csv files or other keepass databases and check and removing duplicates
- automatically set up groups for new entries based on the referrer URL of the new entry
-------

####in the future i plan to expand this project when i have time with the following functions.

- a minimal local web interface with flask, To be able to manage your keepass database wherever you have a browser and python, effectively making it unnecessary to install another software to manage your database

- Other methods of importing passwords other than just csv files or other keepass databases
